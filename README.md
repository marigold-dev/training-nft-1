## What are NFTs?

A non-fungible token is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger. NFTs can be used to represent easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items, and use blockchain technology to establish a verified and public proof of ownership.

## What is IPFS?

The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. In this tutorial, we will be using nft.storage to store the metadata for NFTs.

## Smart Contracts

We will be building two contracts for the marketplace. First will be the token contract. On Tezos FA2 is the standard for Non-fungible Token contracts. We will be using the template provided by Ligo to build out the Token Contract. The template contains the basic entry points for building a Fungible or Non-fungible token including

- Minting tokens
- Transfer
- Adding operators
